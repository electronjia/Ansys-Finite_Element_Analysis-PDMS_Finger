# FiniteElementAnalysis-PDMS
Performed Finite Element Analysis on Pneumatically Actuated Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) Fingers


Designed and analyzed the structure for pressure, strain, deformation, and stress for project called “Finite Element Analysis of “Pneumatically Actuated PDMS Fingers” using Ansys Workbench”. I utilized tools like engineering data entry, DesignModeler, Mechanical, Shear Elastic Strain and directional deformation simulations.

Summary: Created PDMS fingers using DesignModeler and performed Finite Element Analysis on PDMS Fingers using Static Structural Analysis tool in Ansys Workbench.
